Headings communicate the organization of the content on the page. Web browsers, plug-ins, and assistive technologies can use them to provide in-page navigation.

## Heading ranks

Nest headings by their rank (or level). The most important heading has the rank 1 (`<h1>`), the least important heading rank 6 (`<h6>`). Headings with an equal or higher rank start a new section, headings with a lower rank start new subsections that are part of the higher ranked section.

Skipping heading ranks can be confusing and should be avoided where possible: Make sure that a `<h2>` is **not** followed directly by an `<h4>`, for example. It is ok to skip ranks when closing subsections, for instance, a `<h2>` beginning a new section, can follow an `<h4>` as it closes the previous section.

### Exception for fixed page sections

In fixed sections of the page, for example in sidebars, the heading ranks _should not_ change depending on the ranks  in the content area. In those cases, consistency across pages is more important.

## Organize passages of text

In the following example, headings are used to only organize passages of text on a page, for example the main content:

{::nomarkdown}
{% include box.html type="start" title="Example" class="example" %}
{:/}

{% include image.html src="page-structure/page-structure-headings-intro.png" srcset="page-structure/page-structure-headings-intro.png, page-structure/page-structure-headings-intro@2x.png 2x, page-structure/page-structure-headings-intro@3x.png 3x" alt="One example (h1) heading (Space Teddy) with three h2 headings inside the content (Cotton Fur, Sapphire Eyes, Synthetic Felt Paws)." class="" %}

{::nomarkdown}
{% include box.html type="end" %}
{:/}

## Headings that reflect the page organization

Headings are useful for labeling page regions. Use `aria-labelledby` to associate headings with their page region, as described in the [label page regions](/tutorials/page-structure/labels/#using-aria-labelledby) section of this tutorial. If the headings are visible, the regions are easy to identify for all users.

### Main heading before navigation
{:.ex}

In this first example, the heading with the rank 1 is the first heading in the document. All other headings for structuring the page (Navigation Menu, Sidebar, Footer) are one rank lower, and so is the heading for the main content.

{::nomarkdown}
{% include box.html type="start" title="Example" class="example" %}
{:/}

{% include image.html src="page-structure/page-structure-headings.png" srcset="page-structure/page-structure-headings.png, page-structure/page-structure-headings@2x.png 2x, page-structure/page-structure-headings@3x.png 3x" alt="One h1 heading with several h2s and h3 creating subsections. One subsection’s heading is ”(h3) Sapphire Eyes” which has a subsection “(h4) How they are made”. The next heading is an h2, indicating that the (h4) and (h3) subsections are both closed now." class="normal" %}

{::nomarkdown}
{% include box.html type="end" %}
{:/}

{% include ednote.html note="Figure out how to display links now that the sidebar is not available anymore." %}

### Main heading after navigation
{:.ex}

In this second example, the main heading is not the site name but the content heading, which is rank 1. The subheadings in the content are rank 2 as are all the other structural headings.

{::nomarkdown}
{% include box.html type="start" title="Example" class="example" %}
{:/}

{% include image.html src="page-structure/page-structure-headings-2.png" srcset="page-structure/page-structure-headings-2.png, page-structure/page-structure-headings-2@2x.png 2x, page-structure/page-structure-headings-2@3x.png 3x" alt="The page starts with an (h2) Navigation Menu, followed by an (h2) Sidebar and an (h1) Space Teddy. The following headings are all (h2) subsections, including the footer which – " class="normal" %}

{::nomarkdown}
{% include box.html type="end" %}
{:/}
