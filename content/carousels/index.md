Implement an accessible carousel widget by providing a robust structure and user control:

* **[Structure](/tutorials/carousels/structure/):**  Use semantic structure for the carousel to support proper function of assistive technology.
* **[Functionality](/tutorials/carousels/functionality/):** Add functionality to display and announce carousel items.
* **[Animations](/tutorials/carousels/animations/):** Add a transition animation between items and ensure users can stop and resume it.
* **[Styling](/tutorials/carousels/styling/):** Style the carousel to make sure it’s usable and readable by everyone.

See also the [complete working example](/tutorials/carousels/working-example/) and [full code](/tutorials/carousels/full-code/) of the example carousel.

## What are carousels?

Carousels show a collection of items one at a time. They are also known as “slideshows” and “sliders”. Typical uses of carousels include scrolling news headlines, featured articles on home pages, and image galleries.

## What makes a carousel accessible?

- Users must be able to pause carousel movement because it can be too fast or distracting, making text hard to read.
- All functionality, including navigating between carousel items, must be operable by keyboard.
- Changes to carousel items must be communicated to all users, including screen reader users.
- The keyboard position (“focus”) is managed in a reasonable and comprehensible fashion.

**Note:** Carousels are disputed from a usability perspective because their content can be hard to discover. Ensuring accessibility can also improve usability.

## Why is this important?

Typically, carousels are prominently located and are used to provide navigation or show page content. Accessible carousels are essential for many website users including:

- **People using keyboard navigation and voice input software** can navigate between individual items.
- **People using screen readers** will understand which item is currently shown and how to navigate between items.
- **People who are distracted by movement** can pause animations.
- **People who need more time to read** can pause animations, providing them with sufficient time to read and understand carousel content.
