Provide labels to identify all form controls, including text fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, and drop-down menus. In most cases, this is done by using the `<label>` element.

{::nomarkdown}
{% include box.html type="end" %}
{:/}

{% include_cached toc.html %}

Labels need to describe the purpose of the form control. This section of the tutorial describes how to provide labels that are properly associated with form controls. Later sections explain how to provide [instructions](instructions.html), [validate user input](validation.html), and [provide feedback](notifications.html) to help users complete your form.

A label and a form control should be associated with each other either implicitly or explicitly. Web browsers provide the label as a larger clickable area, for example, to select or activate the control. It also ensures that assistive technology can refer to the correct label when presenting a form control.

## Associating labels explicitly
{:.newap}

Whenever possible, use the `label` element to associate text with form elements explicitly. The `for` attribute of the label must exactly match the `id` of the form control.

{::nomarkdown}
{% include box.html type="start" title="Example" class="example" %}
{:/}

<form method="post" action="#">
  <label for="firstname">First name: </label>
  <input type="text" name="firstname" id="firstname"><br>
  <input type="checkbox" name="subscribe" id="subscribe">
  <label for="subscribe">Subscribe to newsletter</label>
</form>

{::nomarkdown}
{% include box.html type="end" %}
{:/}

{::nomarkdown}
{% include box.html type="start" title="Code Snippet" class="example" %}
{:/}

~~~ html
<label for="firstname">First name:</label>
<input type="text" name="firstname" id="firstname"><br>

<input type="checkbox" name="subscribe" id="subscribe">
<label for="subscribe">Subscribe to newsletter</label>
~~~

{::nomarkdown}
{% include box.html type="end" %}
{:/}

### Hiding label text
{:.newex}

A label for a form control helps everyone better understand its purpose. In some cases, the purpose may be clear enough from the context when the content is rendered visually. The label can be hidden visually, though it still needs to be provided within the code to support other forms of presentation and interaction, such as for screen reader and speech input users. The method used in this tutorial to hide an element visually but make it available for assistive technologies is explained in [Note on hiding element](#note-on-hiding-elements).

In the example below, the search field is positioned directly beside the search button. The purpose of the text input field is evident from the context in most situations.

{::nomarkdown}
{% include box.html type="start" title="Example" class="example" %}
{:/}

<form method="post" action="#">
  <div>
    <label for="search" class="visuallyhidden">Search: </label>
    <input type="text" name="search" id="search">
    <button type="button">Search</button>
  </div>
</form>

{::nomarkdown}
{% include box.html type="end" %}
{:/}

#### Hiding the label element
{:.ap}

In this approach, the `<label>` element is provided to identify a form control within the code, but it is visually hidden to avoid redundancy for users who can derive the purpose from the visual cues.

{::nomarkdown}
{% include box.html type="start" title="Code Snippet" class="example" %}
{:/}

~~~ html
<label for="search" class="visuallyhidden">Search: </label>
<input type="text" name="search" id="search">
<button type="submit">Search</button>
~~~

{::nomarkdown}
{% include box.html type="end" %}
{:/}

#### Using aria-label
{:.ap}

The `aria-label` attribute can also be used to identify form controls. This approach is well supported by screen readers and other assistive technology, but, unlike the `title` attribute (see below), the information is not conveyed to visual users. The approach should therefore only be used when the label of the control is clear from the surrounding content, like the button in the example below.

{::nomarkdown}
{% include box.html type="start" title="Code Snippet" class="example" %}
{:/}

~~~ html
<input type="text" name="search" aria-label="Search">
<button type="submit">Search</button>
~~~

{::nomarkdown}
{% include box.html type="end" %}
{:/}

#### Using aria-labelledby
{:.ap}

The `aria-labelledby` attribute can also be used to identify form controls. This approach is well supported by screen readers and other assistive technology, but, unlike the `title` attribute (see below), the information is not conveyed to visual users. The approach should therefore only be used when the label of the control is clear from the surrounding content, like the button in the example below.

The `id` of the element containing the label text is used as the value of the `aria-labelledby` attribute.

{::nomarkdown}
{% include box.html type="start" title="Code Snippet" class="example" %}
{:/}

~~~ html
<input type="text" name="search" aria-labelledby="searchbutton">
<button id="searchbutton" type="submit">Search</button>
~~~

{::nomarkdown}
{% include box.html type="end" %}
{:/}

#### Using the `title` attribute
{:.ap}

The `title` attribute can also be used to identify form controls. This approach is generally less reliable and not recommended because some screen readers and assistive technologies do not interpret the `title` attribute as a replacement for the label element, possibly because the `title` attribute is often used to provide non-essential information. The information of the `title` attribute is shown to visual users as a tool tip when hovering over the form field with the mouse.

{::nomarkdown}
{% include box.html type="start" title="Example" class="example" %}
{:/}

<form method="post" action="#">
  <div>
    <input title="Search" type="text" name="search">
    <button type="button">Search</button>
  </div>
</form>

{::nomarkdown}
{% include box.html type="end" %}
{:/}

{::nomarkdown}
{% include box.html type="start" title="Code Snippet" class="example" %}
{:/}

~~~ html
<input title="Search" type="text" name="search">
<button type="submit">Search</button>
~~~

{::nomarkdown}
{% include box.html type="end" %}
{:/}

#### Note on hiding elements

Screen readers and other assistive technology, just as web browsers, hide elements from their users when they are styled using `display: none;` and `visibility: hidden;`.

The common approach used to hide information visually but keep them available to screen reader and other assistive technology users is to use CSS that will keep the information technically visible but practically hidden. For example, presenting the label in a 1-by-1 pixel area, as demonstrated with the CSS class `visuallyhidden` (**do not confuse** with CSS `visibility: hidden`) below:

{::nomarkdown}
{% include box.html type="start" title="Code Snippet" class="example" %}
{:/}

~~~ css
.visuallyhidden {
  border: 0;
  clip: rect(0 0 0 0);
  height: 1px;
  margin: -1px;
  overflow: hidden;
  padding: 0;
  position: absolute;
  width: 1px;
}
~~~

{::nomarkdown}
{% include box.html type="end" %}
{:/}

Note that interactive elements are still active when using this code, so it is not suitable to hide other parts of forms but the labels.

## Associating labels implicitly
{:.newap}

In some situations, form controls cannot be labeled explicitly. For example, a content author might not know the `id` of a form field generated by a script, or that script might not add an `id` at all. In this case, the `label` element is used as a container for both the form control and the label text, so that the two are associated implicitly. Generally, explicit labels are better supported by assistive technology.

{::nomarkdown}
{% include box.html type="start" title="Code Snippet" class="example" %}
{:/}

~~~ html
<label>
  First name:
  <input type="text" name="firstname">
</label>
<br>
<label>
  <input type="checkbox" name="subscribe">
  Subscribe to newsletter
</label>
~~~

{::nomarkdown}
{% include box.html type="end" %}
{:/}

## Labeling buttons

The label of a `<button>` element is set inside the element and can include markup. This allows more advanced accessibility hints to be included, like marking up language change. When using the `<input>` element to create buttons, the label is set in the `value` attribute of the element.

{::nomarkdown}
{% include box.html type="start" title="Example" class="example" %}
{:/}

~~~ html
<button type="submit">Submit</button>
<button type="button">Cancel</button>

<input type="submit" value="Submit">
<input type="button" value="Cancel">
~~~

{::nomarkdown}
{% include box.html type="end" %}
{:/}

{::nomarkdown}
{% include box.html type="start" title="Note" class="simple notes" %}
{:/}

If the image button (`<input type="image">`) is used, the label is set in the `alt` attribute, for example:
`<input type="image" src="searchbutton.png" alt="Search">`. See [Functional Images](/tutorials/images/functional/#image-used-in-a-button) for more information on how to describe images in buttons.

{::nomarkdown}
{% include box.html type="end" %}
{:/}

## Visual position of label text
{:.newex}

In left-to-right languages, it is customary to visually position labels to the right of radio buttons and checkboxes, and to the left or directly above other form fields. Maintaining this practice increases predictability and understandability of your form for all users.

In general, placing labels above the form fields helps reduce horizontal scrolling for people with low vision and mobile device users. However, the usefulness of this approach depends on other design aspects, such as the proximity of other nearby form fields and content, and needs to be assessed individually. The aim should be to maintain a close and distinct visual relationship between the label and the form control.


## Form field controls for mobile
When HTML5 form fields are used, a virtual keyboard appears making it easier to input data.
For example, a `number` field shows a numeric keyboard, a `date` field a native date picker.

Sometime designers propose not including visual field labels. However, most users prefer or even need visible labels to understand the form.
