Menus are used to browse around websites. As they are vital to access content on websites, they need to be operable with pointing devices (like a mouse) and keyboards. This tutorial includes the following pages:

* **[Structure](structure.html):** Mark up menus using (nested) lists to enable easy access to all pages of the website.

* **[Styling](styling.html):** Use different types of menus in different situations, indicate the current page.

* **[Fly-out Menus](flyout.html):** Use fly-out menus to give users quick access to pages in lower hierarchies. They are also for application menus.

* **[Multiple Ways](multiple-ways.html):** Many users benefit from alternative ways to traverse through the content of a website, for example by using sitemaps or breadcrumb trails.

## Why is this important?

Navigation menus reflect the underlying structure of the website’s content. If that content structure is coherent, users will get around the page more easily.

* **Screen reader and keyboard users** should be aware which link is currently in focus. The menu link to the page the user is currently on should be indicated as well.

* **Screen reader users** expect web application menus to work like desktop menus.

* **Mouse and touch screen users** need large targets to click or tap on.

* **Users with shaky hands** need fly-out menus to not disappear immediately after the mouse has left the submenu.
