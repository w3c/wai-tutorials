In-page navigation provides users with links to individual sections of the page. This makes the sections easier to find and reference.

## Anchors

The `id` attribute of any element can be used as an anchor and directly linked to from within the page or externally. If the main content is using `<main id="content">`, attaching `#content` to the end of the URL will scroll the main content into view and focus on it. This is also helpful to people who bookmark commonly used pages and jump directly to the section of the page of interest.

If possible, make those anchors discoverable by adding links to the section on the web page. In this tutorial, you can find such anchors by using the share button displayed near each heading.

## Skip links

{::nomarkdown}
<%= ref :start %>
{:/}

Skip links are used to move directly to different sections on the page. While some of their functionality is duplicated by WAI-ARIA regions, skip links are still useful for users who use the keyboard without other assistive technologies. Many screen reader users are familiar with moving to the main content using skip links.

{::nomarkdown}
<%= ref :middle %>
{:/}

See the Page Structure Tutorial for more information on [regions](/page-structure/regions.html).

{::nomarkdown}
<%= ref :end %>
{:/}

The following example shows skip links that allow users to jump directly to the content and to the navigation.

{::nomarkdown}
<%=code_start%>
{:/nomarkdown}

~~~html
<nav aria-label="Skip Links">
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="#content" class="visuallyhidden focusable">Jump to content</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="#navigation" class="visuallyhidden focusable">Jump to navigation</a>
    </li>
  </ul>
</nav>
~~~

{::nomarkdown}
<%=code_end%>
{:/nomarkdown}

## Table of contents

A table of contents can be a useful way to skim the page by providing an outline for the user. It should be contained in a navigation region, so it can be easily discovered. The “On this Page” box on every tutorial page is an example of a table of contents. The anchors on every heading allow users to skip to those headings directly.
