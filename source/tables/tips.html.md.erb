Feedback on this page is welcome, if you have a question about tables
that isn't answered by this tutorial, you can send it to
[wai-eo-editors@w3.org](mailto:wai-eo-editors@w3.org).

### Tips

-   **Layout tables:** If you're using a table for layout, rather than
    as a grid to display data with headers, don't use any of the
    structural elements and attributes discussed in this tutorial. Using
    tables for layout is discouraged, it's much better to use Cascading
    Style Sheets (CSS) for layout.
-   **Keep it simple:** Complex tables are more work for you as well as
    being more confusing for users. it's better to use a number of
    simple tables, each containing the data for one sub-topic.
-   **Data separation:** Make sure that each separate piece of data has
    its own cell, (not headers in one row and all data in a second
    row) otherwise it will be impossible for screen readers to work out
    the relationships between data across columns. In addition, if the
    table can't be viewed full-screen by sighted visitors, the data in
    the pseudo-rows may no longer align correctly.
-   **Table separation:** If several tables follow one another, don't
    use a single table and put in an additional row of `<th>` cells.
    Screen readers may read aloud all `<th>` cells in a column,
    resulting in confusion. Start a new `<table>` when the topic
    changes.
-   **Alignment:** align text to the left and financial data to the
    right, so that people using screen magnification, larger text sizes
    or smaller screens will be able to find it. especially when a cell
    spans more than one column. It's also helpful to give column
    headings the same alignment as the data in the cells below
-   **Styling header cells:** Consider visually distinguishing the
    `<th>` cells to make them more obvious.

### FAQ

-   **My site uses a table layout for pages, a complete redesign using
    CSS layout is planned for next year, is there something I can do
    right now to make the layout tables more accessible?**

    Yes there is. You can give the `<table>` element a WAI-ARIA *role*
    attribute of "presentation"(role="presentation"). This will hide it
    from most screen readers in most modern browsers.
-   **I've used CSS to give a different background color for odd and
    even rows in my tables, is this OK?**

    It certainly is, this can be a real help to people with reading
    difficulties or who use screen magnification to enlarge text. It
    acts as a visual guide, as well as looking cool. You could even
    consider highlighting the cell (and row/column) on mouseover or
    keyboard focus to help people see where they are. Make sure that the
    color contrast is good for both color combinations though.
