All data tables need to have structural markup (coding) - elements and
attributes that distinguish between header and data cells and define the
relationships between them. . This tutorial shows you how to apply
appropriate structural table markup. It includes the following pages:

-   **[Header cells](headers/):** Identify the topic of a row or column –
    header cells need to be marked up as `<th>` cells;

-   **[Captions](caption/):** Describe the overall topic of a table —
    best practice is to use the `<caption>` element;

-   **[Scope of header cells](scope/):** Defines the range and
    direction of the data cells to which a header applies – use
    *scope*values that identify the appropriate scope;

-   **[Multi-level tables](id-headers/):** A complex table structure
    where a data cell needs to reference several levels of header cells – assign each header cell an *id* and each data cell a *headers*
    attribute that lists all relevant header cell *id* values;

-   **[Summary](summary/):** Provides orientation or navigation hints
    in complex tables -- give a brief overview as the value of the
    *summary* attribute of the `<table>` element or as part of the
    table's `<caption>` element.

**Note:** The techniques in this tutorial should be applied only when a
table is being used to display data in a grid: if a table is used for
layout, (which is discouraged), none of these elements and attributes
should be applied.

## Why is this important?

When data is presented in tabular format, the position and styling of
header cells may be sufficient to let most people know that these
contain key information that gives meaning to related data cell content.
However, the published style is not available to people who need to use
personal stylesheets, and the position alone can't help screen readers
identify the cells that contain the header information. The header cells
need to be explicitly identified so that correct associations can be
made to data cells. Correctly marked up tables mean that:

-   **People using a screen reader:** Can have the row and column headers
    read aloud as they navigate through the table. Screen readers speak
    one cell at a time and can only distinguish header cells from data
    cells if they are properly marked up.
-   **People using personal stylesheets:** Can have header cells more
    prominently styled for easy recognition when there is a difference
    between the elements used for header and data cells.

## How to make tables accessible

Accessible tables have their header cells marked up using `<th>` and
their data cells marked up using `<td>`. For more complex tables
directional and explicit associations may be needed, using scope, id and
headers attributes so that they can be interpreted by assistive
technologies. The structural coding can also be used to represent data
in different ways, for example by larger or differently colored text or
backgrounds, Braille, speech and symbols. Many web authoring tools and
content management systems (CMS) provide functions to define header
cells during table creation without having to manually edit the code.
Other formats available on the Web such as ODF, Word and PDF have
similar mechanisms to mark-up table structure.

## Relationship to WCAG 2.0

Accessible tables are required by the following WCAG 2.0 Success
Criterion:

-   [1.3.1 Info and
    Relationships](http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/#qr-content-structure-separation-programmatic):
    Information, structure, and relationships conveyed through
    presentation can be programmatically determined or are available in
    text. (Level A)
