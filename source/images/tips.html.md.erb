## Tips

-   **Logos:** Images of text that are used as logos are exempt from
    some of the accessibility guidance that applies to other images of
    text, for instance there is no minimum color contrast requirement;
-   **Prioritize information in *alt* values:** Aim to put the most
    important information at the start of the *alt* value, as people
    using high screen magnification may be unable to see more than the
    first two or three words in the *alt* "tooltip" and people who can't
    read quickly may not be able to read as far as the important part of
    the text alternative before the "tooltip" disappears. .
-   **Choosing appropriate text alternatives:**Imagine that you are
    reading the web page aloud over the phone to someone who needs to
    understand the page. This should help you decide what (if any)
    information or function the images have. If they appear to have no
    informative value and aren't links or buttons, it is probably safe
    to treat them as [decorative](../decorative/).
-   **Punctuation within *alt* attributes:**As in visible text, using
    punctuation within the text alternative can make it easier to
    understand. In addition, a space character may be needed within the
    *alt* value if there is no space between the image and adjacent
    text, to avoid having words run together when read by a screen
    reader.

## FAQ

-   **I've been told to remove the *alt* from most of the images in my
    template, is that right?**

    No that's incorrect, the *alt* is a required attribute. If the
    images are part of the page design, and don't convey information,
    you can remove any text values, leaving just the quotes (`alt=""`).
-   **I can't remember - should the alt be a space or null (empty) if a
    description is not needed?**

    It should be null (empty) *alt* text (`alt=""`), with no space
    between the quotes. Having a space between the quotes doesn't
    effectively hide the image from all assistive technologies, for
    instance some screen readers will still announce the presence of an
    image if a space is put between the quotes.
-   **My CMS system puts in a default *alt* of "image of", can I just
    add to that?**

    It will depend on the function of the image, but default values may
    result in inappropriate alternative text. Normally there's no need
    to include words like "image", "icon" or "picture" in the *alt*
    text, people who can see will know this already and screen readers
    announce the presence of an image. There's a good case for including
    text that describes the type of image if it is a painting,
    photograph or illustration, but it's best to avoid the more generic
    terms.

-   **How long can the *alt* text be, is it up to 90 words?**

    The *alt* text should be the briefest, most concise description of
    the image's purpose as possible. If anything more than a short
    phrase or sentence is needed, it would be better to use one of the
    long description methods discussed on the [complex
    images](../complex/) page. People using high screen magnification may be
    able to see only two or three short words in their magnified view of
    the *alt* "tooltip and screen readers are likely to truncate or
    break any long *alt* value.
