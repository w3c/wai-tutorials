Sometimes groups of images are used together to represent one piece of information. For example, a collection of star icons that together represent a rating. In this case, only one of the images needs a text alternative to describe the entire collection, while the other images have a null (empty) `alt` attribute so that they are ignored by assistive technology.

In other cases, a group of images may represent a collection of related images. For example, showing a collection of art impressions that are thematically related. In this case, each image needs its text alternative that describes it individually, as well as its relationship within the group.

## Multiple images conveying a single piece of information
{:.ex}

This group of five images combined shows a product rating. There are five images (three filled stars, one half-filled star and one empty star) indicating the overall rating. The text alternative for the first image is “Rating: 3.5 out of 5 stars”. All other images have a null (empty) `alt` attribute (`alt=""`).

{::nomarkdown}
<%= sample_start %>
{:/nomarkdown}

Rating: ![3.5 out of 5 stars](star-full.png)![](../img/star-full.png)![](../img/star-full.png)![](star-half.png)![](star-empty.png)

{::nomarkdown}
<%= sample_end %>
{:/nomarkdown}

{::nomarkdown}
<%= code_start %>
{:/nomarkdown}

## A collection of images
{:.ex}

In the example below, the HTML5 `<figure>` and `<figcaption>` elements are used to provide a caption for each image in a collection. The `<figure>` element can be nested, which is used in the example to provide a caption for the entire collection of images. The WAI-ARIA attribute `role` with the value of `group` is used to indicate this grouping to assistive technologies, `aria-labelledby` makes sure that the `figcaption` elements are used as labels for the individual groups.

Note: The web browser and assistive technology support vary for this particular WAI-ARIA attribute and value.
