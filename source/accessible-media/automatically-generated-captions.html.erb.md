## The basics of automatic captions

Tools exist today that use sophisticated speech-to-text (STT) technology
to turn a program's soundtrack into a timed caption file, ready for
inclusion with corresponding video. In fact, [most videos uploaded to
YouTube are captioned by Google's automatic-captioning
process](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/3038280), something
many authors do not know. [Automatic captions are available in a number
of languages](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6373554?hl=en).
However, the accuracy of these captions is frequently quite low and
results in poor-quality captions that often contain…

-   text that does not match words spoken in the audio;
-   poor timing (e.g., captions that do not appear synchronously with
    the audio);
-   spelling errors;
-   little or no punctuation;
-   missing capitalization;
-   occasional obscenities (swears, for example).

## Using automatic captions responsibly

**Automatically generated captions should never be used as the sole
method to produce captions.** However, they can be used as a first-pass
or rough-draft effort in the workflow to create an [accurate,
high-quality caption track](production-captions.html). Below is a sample workflow for
using auto-captions as part of the caption-production process, using
YouTube's auto-caption service as an example.

1.  [Upload a video to
    YouTube](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/57407?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en).
2.  [Generate automatic
    captions](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2734796?hl=en).
3.  [Download the
    track](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2734705?hl=en).
4.  Using a caption editor, correct spelling, grammar and timing errors.
5.  Export the cleaned-up caption file to the [appropriate caption
    format for
    YouTube](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2734698?hl=en).
6.  [Upload the new caption file to
    YouTube](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2734796?hl=en).

While authors cannot prevent YouTube from creating the auto-captions,
the captions should always be disabled once the video has been uploaded
so that users cannot turn them on. Read the [instructions for disabling
automatic captions](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2734701).
