For example, they show you how to provide accessible images and tables using a variety of web technologies, including HTML4, HTML5, CSS3, WAI-ARIA, MathML, and SVG. The concepts and techniques explained in the tutorials apply to other formats as well.

Web authoring tools (Content Management Systems (CMS), <abbr title="What you see is what you get">WYSIWYG</abbr> editors, word processors, etc.) can often help you create content that is accessible as shown in these tutorials.

## Relationship to WCAG 2.0

These tutorials provide hints on how to implement best practice solutions that meet WCAG 2.0 in different situations. They do not cover all situations, technologies, success criteria, and conformance requirements. For comprehensive coverage of the requirements, see the normative  [WCAG 2.0 standard](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/) and its supporting materials, such as [How to Meet WCAG 2.0: A customizable quick reference](http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/).
