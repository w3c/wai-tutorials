For example, they show you how to provide accessible images and tables using a variety of web technologies, including HTML4, HTML5, CSS3, WAI-ARIA, MathML, and SVG. The concepts and techniques explained in the tutorials apply to other formats as well.

Web authoring tools (Content Management Systems (CMS), <abbr title="What you see is what you get">WYSIWYG</abbr> editors, word processors, etc.) can often help you create content that is accessible as shown in these tutorials.

## Relationship to WCAG 2

These tutorials provide best-practice guidance on implementing accessibility in different situations. They combine WCAG 2 success criteria and techniques from various conformance levels. Each tutorial page lists the specific success criteria and techniques used on that page. A more comprehensive coverage of the normative [WCAG 2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/) and [WCAG 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) standards and their supporting materials is provided in **[How to Meet WCAG 2: A customizable quick reference](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/)**.
