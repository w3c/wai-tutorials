Welcome to the web accessibility tutorials. We’ve designed these tutorials to help people create websites that reach the widest possible audience. They will help to apply [Accessibility Principles](http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/people-use-web/principles) in the every day workflow of website creators by providing practical guidance and examples that meet [WCAG 2.0](http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag) (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0). They are designed for a variety of people:

* **Web developers** will find guidance and boilerplate solutions for many common coding challenges.
* **Web designers** will learn how to design web components that are easy to implement in an accessible way.
* **Web trainers** will find compelling examples to teach people about accessible web design and development.
* **Content authors** will learn concepts and techniques for preparing their content in an accessible way.
* **Project managers** will gain understanding of accessibility approaches to help with project planning.
* Whatever your role is, **you**’ll find valuable resources.

The tutorials cover various accessibility topics, including some advanced concepts. We've designed them as way to start learning and addressing WCAG. If you want to be sure that you meet WCAG requirements, you'll of course need to use WCAG resources directly.

Most examples are HTML-based, though the underlying principles apply to other formats as well.
