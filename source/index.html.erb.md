Welcome to the web accessibility tutorials. We’ve designed these tutorials to help people create websites that are accessible for the widest possible audience. They will help to apply [Accessibility Principles](http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/people-use-web/principles) in the every day workflow of website creators by providing practical guidance and examples that meet [WCAG 2.0](http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag) (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0). 

The tutorials are designed for a variety of people:

* **Web developers** will find guidance and boilerplate solutions for many common coding challenges.
* **Web designers** will learn how to create web components that are easy to implement for a more inclusive design practice.
* **Web trainers** will find compelling examples to teach people about accessible web design and development.
* **Content authors** will learn concepts and techniques for preparing their content in an accessible way.
* **Project managers** will gain understanding of ways to integrate accessibility thinking into project planning.
* Whatever your role is, **you**’ll find valuable resources.

The tutorials cover various accessibility topics, including some advanced concepts. We've designed them as way to start learning and addressing WCAG. If you want to be sure that you meet WCAG requirements, you'll of course need to use WCAG resources directly.

Most examples are HTML-based, though the underlying principles apply to other formats as well.

Authoring tools (Content Management Systems, <abbr title="What you see is what you get">WYSIWYG</abbr> editors, word processors, …) used to produce content should be able to create documents that meet WCAG 2.0 requirements. The requirements for these tools are defined in the [Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines 2.0](http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/atag). It’s important that you further investigate the accessiblity features of the authoring tools used in your environment as you use these tutorials. Be sure that you understand the capability of your tools to produce accessible content and take care to implement and maintain accessibility with the tools at hand.
