Welcome to the web accessibility tutorials. We've designed these tutorials to help people create websites that reach the widest possible audience. They will help to apply [Accessibility Principles](http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/people-use-web/principles) in the every day workflow of website creators by providing practical guidance and examples that meet [WCAG 2.0](http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag) (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0). They are designed for a variety of people:

* **Web developers** will find guidance and boilerplate solutions for many common coding challenges.
* **Web designers** will learn how to design web components that are easy to implement in an accessible way.
* **Web trainers** will find compelling examples to teach people about accessible web design and development.
* **Content authors** will learn concepts and techniques for preparing their content in an accessible way.
* **Project managers** will gain understanding of accessibility approaches to help with project planning.
* Whatever your role is, **you**â€™ll find valuable resources.

The tutorials introduce accessibility topics, including advanced aspects. They are a good starting point for learning and addressing WCAG. To ensure that you meet the WCAG requirements, you will still have to use WCAG resources directly.

Most of the examples are HTML-based and the underlying principles apply to other formats as well.
