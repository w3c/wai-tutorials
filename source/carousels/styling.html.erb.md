## Button Size

Use appropriately sized buttons and links to allow [people with physical impairments](https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/people-use-web/diversity#physical) to use the carousel more easily. This will also benefit people using touch screens.

As a rule of thumb, {::comment} See what I did there? {:/} a minimal physical size of 9 × 9 mm for interactive elements [is recommended](https://www.w3.org/TR/mobile-accessibility-mapping/#h-touch-target-size-and-spacing) and it helps if the element is surrounded by a small amount of inactive space. While you could use millimeters in CSS, the physical rendering size might differ from device to device depending on resolution and display size. Use a minimum of 45 × 45 px in CSS to cover a 9 × 9 mm space on many devices.

## Contrast

Ensure sufficient contrast between the foreground and the background of text, links, and buttons. This can be a challenge when text or buttons are positioned on top of images. You can use a (semi-transparent) background color or move the buttons outside of the image to ensure sufficient contrast.

## Labels

Typically space on the carousel is too limited to provide the full title of each item on the buttons. In this case the items are numbered and used at the button text. @@ In addition, hidden labels can be used to provide the full titles, especially for the next and previous buttons.

## Indicating states

Since the buttons are typically small, it is important to indicate their status both in color and shape (in addition to proper naming and labeling). In this example a filled square is used for buttons associated with items currently not shown. The “active” button (that is associated with the current item) has a white background, a blue border and slightly rounded corners. When a keyboard user focuses or a mouse user hovers a button, that button will have a dashed border.

In the following example, the carousel is showing item 1.

{::nomarkdown}
<%= sample_start %>

<style>
.slidenav li {
  display: inline-block;
}
.slidenav button {
  border: 2px solid #036;
  background-color: #036;
  line-height: 1em;
  height: 2em;
  width: 2em;
  font-weight: bold;
  color: #fff;
}

.slidenav button.current {
  border-radius: .5em;
  background-color: #fff;
  color: #333;
}

.slidenav button:hover,
.slidenav button:focus {
  border: 2px dashed #fff;
}

.slidenav button.current:hover,
.slidenav button.current:focus {
  border: 2px dashed #036;
}
</style>

<ul class="slidenav as-sample">
  <li>
    <button class="current" data-slide="0" type="button">
      <span class="visuallyhidden">News</span> 1
      <span class="visuallyhidden">(Current Slide)</span>
    </button>
  </li>
  <li>
    <button data-slide="1" type="button">
      <span class="visuallyhidden">News</span> 2
    </button>
  </li>
  <li>
    <button data-slide="2" type="button">
      <span class="visuallyhidden">News</span> 3
    </button>
  </li>
</ul>

<style>
  .slidenav.as-sample {
    position: static;
  }
</style>
