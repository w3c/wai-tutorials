Develop carousels in an accessible way using best practices:

- **[Structure](structure.html):** Provide structure markup for the carousel body and its items.

- **[Functionality](functionality.html):** Add functionality to display and announce carousel items.

- **[Animations](animations.html):** Add animation and ensure users have control over these animations.

See also a [Complete Example](full-code.html) including the full source code.

Carousels allow users to select to view one item from a series of content items. Common examples are slide shows other sliders, like scrolling news headlines, images or featured articles. Carousels often move from item to item automatically, which can be too fast to read or distracting for some users.

## Why is this important?

Carousels should have functionality to allow users to pause movement. All functionalit needs to be usable by keyboard. Implementing them accessibly is essential for many website visitors including:

- **People using keyboard navigation and voice input software** can navigate between carousel items.
- **People using screen readers** will understand where they are and how to navigate between carousel items.
- **People who are distracted by movement** are able to pause the animations while reading the web page.
- **People who need more time to read** have sufficient time to read and understand each carousel item.
