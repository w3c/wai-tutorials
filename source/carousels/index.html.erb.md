Develop carousels using progressive enhancement techniques:

- **[Structure](structure.html):** Provide structure markup for the carousel body and its items.

- **[Functionality](functionality.html):** Add functionality to display and announce carousel items.

- **[Animations](animations.html):** Add animation and ensure users have control over these animations.

## Why is this important?

Carousels, also referred to as “slide shows” and “sliders”, display one item from a series of content items. Common examples are scrolling news headlines and images, like featured articles. Carousels often use animations to move from item to item, which can be distracting for some users. They may also move too fast for some users to be able to read.

Carousels should have functionality to allow users to pause and advance animations. They also need to be implemented in a way that is usable by keyboard. Given their prominence, accessible carousels are essential for many website visitors including:

- **People using keyboard navigation and voice input software** can navigate between carousel items.
- **People using screen readers** will understand where they are and how to navigate between carousel items.
- **People who are distracted by movement** are able to pause the animations while reading the web page.
- **People who need more time to read** have sufficient time to read and understand each carousel item.
