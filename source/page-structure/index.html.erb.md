A good page structure makes it easier for everyone to understand the content and also facilitates the effectiveness of users that use assistive technology. Use HTML and WAI-ARIA to improve navigation and orientation on web pages and in applications.

* **[Page Regions](regions.html):** Identify and mark up regions on web pages using HTML5 and WAI-ARIA roles.

* **[Labeling Regions](labels.html):** Name regions to allow users to distinguish and access them.

* **[Search Region](search.html):** Direct access to a search functionality, when present, makes it easy to find content on websites.

* **[Headings](headings.html):** Add logically nested headings of different levels to label sections of content.

* **[Content Structure](content.html):** Mark up the content on a page in a way that uses the best available element.

## Why is this important?

A good page structure makes prioritizing and identifying content easier for everyone, in particular for those with congnitive and learning disabilities. The visual structure serves as cues that are used by people with visual impairments, including people with low vision, to orient themselves on the page and in the content.

* **People using screen readers** can skip to the content directly and navigate to sections that are important to them.
* **Keyboard users** will be more efficient when they are able to navigate the page bypassing some sections. If this is not possible, users need to use multiple strokes of the tab key to navigate through the links in a specific section.
* **People using software that only shows the main content** of a web page, such as people with cognitive disabilities, will receive better results if the page structure is correctly marked up.
* **Mobile web users** often have access to a so-called “reader” or “reading” mode that will only show the main content of the page if it is correctly marked up.
* **People using certain browser plugins** can use landmark roles to jump to specific sections on a page.

There are additional benefits to a good, accessible page structure, beyond those experienced by people with disabilities. As an example, search engines can use the data to make better predictions on the real content of a web page.
