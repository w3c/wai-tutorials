Well-structured content allows more efficient navigation and processing. Use HTML and WAI-ARIA to improve navigation and orientation on web pages and in applications.

* **[Page Regions](regions.html):** Identify and mark up regions on web pages using HTML5 and WAI-ARIA roles.

* **[Labeling Regions](labels.html):** Label regions to allow users to distinguish and access them.

* **[Headings](headings.html):** Add headings and nest them logically to label sections of web pages according to their relationships and importance.

* **[Content Structure](content.html):** Mark up the content on a page in a way that uses appropriate and meaningful elements.

## Why is this important?

Pages with well-structured content are essential for many web users, for example:

* **People with cognitive and learning disabilities** are more easily find and prioritize content on the page.
* **People using screen readers** can skip to the main content directly and navigate to sections that are important to them.
* **Keyboard users** can browse pages and their sections more efficiently. Otherwise, users have press the tab key  multiple times to navigate through all links in each section.
* **People using software that only shows the main content** of a web page, such as people with cognitive disabilities, will receive better results if the page structure is correctly marked up.
* **People with visual impairments**, including people with low vision, have cues that provide orientation on the page and in the content.
* **Mobile web users** often have access to a so-called “reader” or “reading” mode that will only show the main content of the page if it is correctly marked up.
* **People using certain browser plugins** can use landmark roles to jump to specific sections on a page.
* There are additional benefits to a good, accessible page structure, beyond those experienced by people with disabilities. As an example, search engines can use the data to better index the content of a page.
