## How to contribute

Basically, editing files works like a Wiki.

Browse to the file using the [Github Page][GHPage] and click on the “Fork and Edit” button of the page. This will bring you to the Github detail page of that file where you can start editing the file using the edit button in the top right corner, if you’re logged into Github. [Here’s an example in the Images Tutorial.][exmpImg]

You can start editing right away. We use the standard Markdown syntax. If you get the following note, this is expected behavior:

> You are editing a file in a project you do not have write access to. We are forking this project for you (if one does not yet exist) to write your proposed changes to. Submitting a change to this file will write it to a new branch in your fork so you can send a pull request.

It is technical for “All right, make your edits, we make sure you can send them in as a proposal!”

Don’t forget to add some descriptive text at the bottom that comments your change. Try to be concise. Klick the “Propose this change” button to continue. Then you get another comment field, you can write down your motivation for the change here. Once you click “Send pull request” the editor of the notified of your proposal and may adopt it.

Note that the changes are not immediately reflected on any page. If you want to see your changes in HTML that way is more technical and is described briefly in the following part of the document. But there is a preview button in the editor that gives you a fairly good example of how the rendered HTML will look like.
